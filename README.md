# Fintech Cybersecurity: Access Control & Defense Mechanisms

## Description
A quick yet detailed guide for fintech professionals, cybersecurity students, and IT teams on some of the most crucial cybersecurity concepts every organization should adopt — EDR, ZTA, RBAC, MFA, LPA, and Audit Logging.

## Extended Description
In the digital finance space, sensitive information and high-value transactions are always targets for cybercriminals. This repo breaks down six essential cybersecurity pillars in a clear and beginner-friendly way. Whether you're managing infrastructure or writing security policies, these tools and principles help minimize risk, detect threats early, and enforce trust within your organization. Especially tailored for fintech environments, this documentation is a practical cybersecurity checklist to elevate your access control game.

## Topics Covered

### 1. 🛡️ EDR - Endpoint Detection & Response
**What it is**:  
EDR is a software solution that continuously monitors end-user devices (laptops, desktops, mobile phones) for signs of malicious activity.

**How it works**:  
- Detects anomalies (e.g. unusual file transfers, privilege escalation).
- Provides alerts to security teams.
- Can quarantine affected devices.
- Logs and helps investigate threats.

**💼 Fintech Example**:  
An EDR system flags an unauthorized script running on the CFO's laptop during off-hours. The script was trying to exfiltrate payroll data.

### 2. 🔐 ZTA - Zero Trust Architecture
**What it is**:  
“Never trust, always verify.” ZTA assumes that every device, user, or connection could be compromised — even within the network.

**How it works**:  
- Requires continuous authentication and verification.
- Limits lateral movement inside the network.
- Enforces least privilege and micro-segmentation.

**Why it matters in Fintech**:  
ZTA helps protect sensitive financial data even when internal accounts are compromised.

### 3. 👥 RBAC - Role-Based Access Control  
**What it is**:  
A method of restricting access based on a user’s role in the organization.

**How it works**:  
- Employees are assigned roles (e.g. accountant, developer, auditor).
- Each role has predefined permissions.
- Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive functions.

**Example**:  
A teller at a bank can view transaction history but cannot approve large transfers — only a manager can.

### 4. 🔑 MFA - Multi-Factor Authentication  
**What it is**:  
A security measure requiring more than one method of authentication from independent sources to verify a user’s identity.

**How it works**:  
- Something you know (password)
- Something you have (OTP device or phone)
- Something you are (biometric)

**Use case**:  
Logging into a fintech dashboard requires a password *and* a fingerprint or one-time passcode sent to your device.

### 5. 🚫 LPA - Least Privilege Access  
**What it is**:  
Each user or process gets the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job.

**Why it’s important**:  
Reduces damage in case of a breach. For example, a junior accountant doesn’t need access to server configurations.

**Common mistake**:  
Leaving admin access open for convenience, which hackers can later exploit.

---

### 6. 📊 Audit Logs  
**What it is**:  
A chronological record of system activities, security events, and user behavior.

**What it helps with**:
- Detecting insider threats
- Investigating breaches
- Ensuring regulatory compliance

**Example in Fintech**:  
An audit log reveals repeated failed login attempts to the core banking system at odd hours — an early sign of a brute-force attack.

## 🧩 Conclusion

Strong access control and visibility mechanisms are non-negotiable in fintech. Incorporating tools like EDR, principles like ZTA, and access models like RBAC or LPA protects your data, systems, and clients from both insider and outsider threats.
